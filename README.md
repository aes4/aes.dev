# aes.dev

## Project Overview
aes.dev is a personal programming project that serves as a platform for me to build and use my own text editor, and add any features I want. I built this because I enjoy programming and wanted to create a tool that I could use wherever I am. This project is open to use by anyone who finds it useful, and I'm open to feature recommendations.

## Technologies Used
This project is built using the following main technologies:
- Node.js
- Express
- EJS

## Main Features
The website includes a text editor that is built using the HTML5 Canvas API for dynamic view manipulation.

## How It Works
The website navigation might seem unintuitive at first as it uses a command-like structure. The semicolon (;) is used as a prefix to issue commands. For example, to edit a piece of text, use `;e textname`. The command `;v commands.txt` should display a list of commands, though this is still under development.

## Current Status and Future Plans
The text editor is mostly functional, but the project as a whole is still a work in progress. The next big milestones include adding the ability to edit multiple texts within a single window and enabling the customization of editor keybinds, as the current keybinds are not qwerty-friendly.

## Local Setup
Instructions on how to set up this project locally will be provided in the future.

## Contributions
While I appreciate interest in the project, I'm currently not accepting contributions. However, I'm open to feature recommendations and feedback.

## Contact
